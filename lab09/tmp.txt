san
francisco
the
calendar
may
say
but
in
tech
culture
this
week
actually
marks
the
year
a
f
after
facebook
what
did
we
poor
humans
do
before
the
advent
of
mark
zuckerberg's
collegiate
brainstorm
let's
see
we
smiled
when
we
liked
something
we
dialed
the
phone
to
update
friends
and
tagging
was
a
kids'
game
the
upside
of
those
innocent
pre-social
media
times
intimacy
the
downside
intimacy
if
you
wanted
to
reach
a
huge
group
it
meant
sending
an
e-mail
with
a
cc
list
that
looked
like
the
phone
book
then
came
teenage
zuck
and
his
shrewdly
rolled-out
vision
for
a
new
kind
of
digital
club
where
you
played
bouncer
all
with
a
machiavellian
backstory
that
eventually
merited
its
own
oscar-winning
movie
the
social
network
facebook
haters
crowed
after
its
hyped
ipo
last
may
quickly
went
sour
but
the
company
has
bounced
back
with
a
fiscal
vengeance
by
the
end
of
its
turbo-charged
stock
had
made
founder
zuckerberg
a
billion
man
thanks
to
billion
in
annual
revenue
a
jump
over
fueling
such
growth
was
rapid
mobile
adoption
which
last
quarter
accounted
for
of
all
advertising
and
paves
the
way
for
a
bullish
new
year
story
the
sad
fate
of
facebook's
rivals
at
the
heart
of
this
business
boom
is
a
service
that
over
the
past
decade
has
revolutionized
and
expanded
for
better
or
for
worse
the
way
humans
interact
a
million
of
us
liked
the
site
in
then
million
five
years
later
today
facebook
has
billion
users
even
if
the
site
were
to
disappear
or
wildly
reinvent
itself
in
the
next
decade
our
habits
are
forever
altered
the
biggest
impact
of
facebook
was
that
it
broke
us
out
of
e-mail
jail
says
paul
saffo
a
longtime
silicon
valley
futurist
e-mail
implied
you
had
to
reply
facebook
did
not
e-mail
is
formal
facebook
is
a
salutation
e-mail
you
send
facebook
you
broadcast
it's
simply
a
new
social
medium
for
which
were
still
learning
the
social
norms
while
facebook
has
spawned
plenty
of
unappealing
habits
oversharing
perhaps
topping
that
list
its
genius
was
in
creating
a
platform
that
allowed
people
to
connect
over
long
distances
and
reconnect
over
lost
years
it
tapped
into
a
yearning
that
grew
with
the
geographic
scattering
of
the
nation's
workforce
your
childhood
neighborhood
may
be
but
a
memory
but
it
could
gather
once
again
on
facebook
in
the
recent
past
if
you
left
people
physically
for
a
job
or
marriage
you
simply
moved
on
but
facebook
made
maintaining
those
relationship
easy
says
danah
boyd
of
microsoft
research
and
author
of
the
forthcoming
book
it's
complicated
the
social
lives
of
networked
teens
the
important
takeaway
from
facebook's
rise
is
that
people
have
a
desire
to
connect
broadly
she
says
for
the
longest
time
technology
limited
communication
to
one
on
one
just
think
of
the
telephone
but
now
our
worlds
are
complicated
networks
that
overlap
the
implications
of
that
have
yet
to
be
fully
realized
staying
connected
that
may
well
be
but
most
of
today's
facebook
users
arent
too
concerned
with
the
sociological
ramifications
of
a
shift
in
human
communication
they're
just
glad
they
can
keep
grandma
or
little
billy
posted
on
what's
new
i
lived
in
california
and
my
grandmother
lived
in
upper
michigan
and
i
had
felt
really
badly
about
losing
touch
until
she
got
a
laptop
and
signed
up
for
facebook
says
kristy
campbell
a
communications
director
at
juniper
networks
our
world
opened
up
to
her
she
attended
my
daughter's
graduation
and
prom
via
facebook
and
when
she
suddenly
passed
away
i
was
left
with
a
digital
record
of
our
interactions
that
i
will
never
take
down
says
campbell
who
also
used
the
site
to
create
a
network
of
divorcees
that
helped
each
other
through
that
life
change
i
really
dont
remember
life
before
facebook
for
every
facebook
user
who
may
have
gotten
tired
of
maintaining
their
page
and
quit
countless
testimonials
speak
to
the
network's
transformative
effect
ann
friedlander
of
west
palm
beach
fla
has
children
in
hong
kong
connecticut
and
california
without
facebook
she
says
i'd
never
know
what
they're
up
to
or
see
photos
of
my
grandchildren
ann
friedlander

she
also
used
the
site
to
get
back
in
touch
with
childhood
friends
in
new
jersey
and
more
poignantly
discovered
through
facebook
that
a
neighbor
died
on
trying
to
rescue
someone
in
remote
morro
bay
midway
down
the
california
coast
kelly
lipton
uses
facebook
to
ease
her
sense
of
isolation
which
is
amplified
by
hearing
issues
i
find
facebook
is
a
good
way
to
keep
up
she
says
i
love
it
so
much
i
can't
believe
it
and
while
much
has
been
made
of
late
about
how
younger
generations
are
fast
migrating
away
from
facebook
to
newer
social
networking
sites
and
apps
bella
maestas
of
hillsborough
calif
loves
the
way
facebook
helps
her
tackle
homework
with
classmates
and
stay
connected
socially
in
a
way
it
takes
the
place
of
the
diary
she
says
it
also
leaves
a
mark
of
you
on
the
world
everyone
wants
to
be
known
noticed
and
remembered
missionary
zeal
whether
zuckerberg
knew
he
was
tapping
into
something
as
universal
as
a
need
to
reach
out
and
be
remembered
is
unknown
but
by
all
accounts
a
missionary's
zeal
permeated
the
initially
small
silicon
valley
offices
of
facebook
as
the
company
built
momentum
it
was
pretty
remarkable
when
i
started
in
late
still
a
living
room
operation
in
los
altos
hills
says
ezra
callahan
who
joined
the
team
just
out
of
stanford
and
was
employee
no
he
left
in
and
took
a
year
to
recover
the
all-in
intensity
was
such
that
employees
were
encouraged
to
live
as
close
to
work
as
possible
you
were
given
a
-a-month
stipend
if
you
lived
within
a
mile
of
the
company
and
half
of
us
qualified
he
says
it
was
intentional
we
were
a
family
the
value
of
having
such
a
close
culture
was
it
made
people
want
to
stay
and
work
harder
peter
sealey
a
former
marketing
director
at
coca-cola
and
columbia
pictures
joined
facebook's
board
of
advisers
a
few
years
after
its
launch
even
then
he
says
you
could
immediately
tell
these
people
were
working
on
something
that
would
have
a
profound
impact
on
society
sealey
says
to
him
facebook's
future
was
self-evident
when
he
took
into
account
technologist
george
gilder's
law
which
states
that
the
value
of
a
network
goes
up
with
the
square
of
the
number
of
users
today
the
catholic
church
has
billion
members
and
so
does
facebook
in
just
years
he
says
humans
have
an
ingrained
need
to
have
a
tribe
and
to
share
among
that
tribe
myspace
could
have
won
this
battle
but
zuckerberg
just
built
a
more
convenient
and
familiar
service
speaking
of
the
harvard
dropout
he's
in
good
company
so
was
bill
gates
it's
clear
zuckerberg
doesn't
intend
to
rest
on
his
laurels
or
his
cash
we
can
do
a
better
job
informing
members
about
newly
added
features
zuckerberg
told
usa
today
at
a
company
event
in
menlo
park
in
december
we
have
focus
groups
explaining
what
we
intend
to
do
but
we
still
catch
a
lot
of
people
by
surprise
facebook's
willingness
to
be
flexible
with
its
approach
when
it
has
to
be
will
be
key
to
its
future
says
bret
taylor
the
company's
former
chief
technology
officer
who
oversaw
integration
with
apple's
ios
software
as
well
as
the
adoption
of
the
famous
like
button
facebook
could
be
very
different
in
years
but
i
see
it
being
around
because
it's
not
afraid
to
change
often
he
says
offering
as
example
the
company's
purchase
of
photo-sharing
site
instagram
for
billion
last
april
there
are
interesting
parallels
in
google
buying
youtube
and
facebook
buying
instagram
i
was
at
each
company
when
that
happened
and
both
were
criticized
for
overpaying
he
says
both
turned
out
to
be
good
deals
it
is
hugely
important
in
moving
forward
to
show
a
willingness
to
be
bold
what
lies
ahead
as
for
the
future
there
was
some
buzz
recently
about
a
princeton
university
study
that
said
facebook
was
akin
to
a
viral
outbreak
that
would
mercifully
abate
losing
of
its
peak
user
base
in
the
next
few
years
facebook's
cheeky
response
was
to
offer
a
report
by
its
data
scientists
predicting
that
princeton
will
have
only
half
its
current
enrollment
by
and
by
it
will
have
no
students
at
all
jibes
and
parries
aside
facebook's
next
decade
is
likely
to
be
more
tumultuous
than
its
culturally
dominant
first
years
a
recent
ypulse
survey
revealed
that
of
those
under
thought
facebook
was
losing
its
cool
factor
but
regardless
of
this
cultural
patriarchs
future
the
best
way
to
judge
facebooks
impact
is
the
same
way
we
ultimately
assess
the
job
of
any
parent
by
their
kids
which
in
social
media
terms
include
twitter
snapchat
whatsapp
and
international
successes
such
as
japans
line
and
chinas
wechat
facebook
taught
us
that
the
internet
could
be
used
to
share
our
lives
in
a
way
and
with
a
scope
that
was
novel
and
just
as
the
dominant
communication
tool
of
the
moment
was
growing
ponderous
remember
when
america
online
started
and
youd
hear
that
ping
and
the
voice
said
youve
got
mail
well
that
soon
had
turned
into
argh
i've
got
mail
says
author
boyd
with
a
laugh
then
facebook
came
along
and
all
of
a
sudden
oooo
there
are
all
my
friends
there
may
be
a
lot
of
shiny
new
social
media
apps
out
there
now
but
facebooks
impact
was
as
extraordinarily
important
as
aol's
aol
opened
up
people
to
the
internet
facebook
opened
up
people
to
each
other

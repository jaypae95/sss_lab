Your childhood neighborhood may be but a memory, but it could gather once again on Facebook. 

“In the recent past, if you left people physically for a job or marriage, you simply moved on, but Facebook made maintaining those relationship easy,” says Danah Boyd of Microsoft Research and author of the forthcoming book, It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens. 

“The important takeaway from Facebook's rise is that people have a desire to connect broadly,” she says.  “For the longest time, technology limited communication to one on one; just think of the telephone.  But now our worlds are complicated networks that overlap.  The implications of that have yet to be fully realized.” 

STAYING CONNECTED 

That may well be, but most of today's Facebook users aren’t too concerned with the sociological ramifications of a shift in human communication.  They're just glad they can keep grandma or little Billy posted on what's new. 

“I lived in California and my grandmother lived in upper Michigan, and I had felt really badly about losing touch until she got a laptop and signed up for Facebook,” says Kristy Campbell, 46, a communications director at Juniper Networks. 

“Our world opened up to her.  She attended my daughter's graduation and prom via Facebook, and when she suddenly passed away.  I was left with a digital record of our interactions that I will never take down,” says Campbell, who also used the site to create a network of divorcees that helped each other through that life change.  “I really don’t remember life before Facebook.” 

For every Facebook user who may have gotten tired of maintaining their page and quit, countless testimonials speak to the network's transformative effect.

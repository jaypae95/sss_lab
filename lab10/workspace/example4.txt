He left in 2010 and took “a year to recover. ” The all-in intensity was such that employees were encouraged to live as close to work as possible. 

“You were given a $600-a-month stipend if you lived within a mile of the company, and half of us qualified,” he says.  “It was intentional.  We were a family.  The value of having such a close culture was it made people want to stay and work harder.” 

Peter Sealey, a former marketing director at Coca-Cola and Columbia Pictures, joined Facebook's board of advisers a few years after its launch.  “Even then,” he says, “you could immediately tell these people were working on something that would have a profound impact on society.” 

Sealey says to him Facebook's future was self-evident when he took into account technologist George Gilder's law, which states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. 

“Today, the Catholic Church has 1.2 billion members, and so does Facebook, in just 10 years,” he says.  “Humans have an ingrained need to have a tribe and to share among that tribe.  Myspace could have won this battle, but Zuckerberg just built a more convenient and familiar service.” 

Speaking of the Harvard dropout (he's in good company: so was Bill Gates), it's clear Zuckerberg doesn't intend to rest on his laurels or his cash. 

“We can do a better job” informing members about newly added features, Zuckerberg told USA TODAY at a company event in Menlo Park in December.  “We have focus groups explaining what we intend to do, but we still catch a lot of people by surprise.” 

Facebook's willingness to be flexible with its approach when it has to be will be key to its future, says Bret Taylor, the company's former chief technology officer who oversaw integration with Apple's iOS software as well as the adoption of the famous Like button.
